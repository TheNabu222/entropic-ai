## Gaps to Fill:
1. Introduction to Aspects section
2. Missing Pluto aspects:
   - Pluto-Venus

4. Additional planetary combinations needed for completeness:

5. Synthesis sections needed:

6. Concluding section:

Would you like me to:
1. Continue organizing the existing content into this structure
2. Start drafting any of the missing sections
3. Focus on a specific subset of aspects first?
