Consciousness is relentless
    ↓
Need break from consciousness
    ↓
Try normal escape mechanisms
    ↓
All boring because unproductive
    ↓
Only productive activity satisfies
    ↓
But productive activity isn't rest
    ↓
Trapped in need for escape that doesn't exist
    ↓
Documentation becomes only sustainable outlet
    ↓
Because it's productive AND engaging AND satisfies OCD
