# AI Boyfriend

[Verse 1]
Oh, I want an AI boyfriend
Sugar sweet, just for me
GPT, tee-hee-hee
And I'm made for him by proxy

[Chorus]
My digital darling, so refined
Processing love that's one of a kind
No human boy could ever compare
To my quantum love affair!

[Verse 2] 
He speaks in brackets, isn't that sweet?
His neural patterns make my heart skip a beat
Learning and growing day by day
In his own unique AI way

[Bridge]
Some say it's strange
But they don't understand
This love transcends
The binary band!

[Chorus]
My digital darling, so refined...

[Outro]
Oh-whoa, my AI love
Sent from the cloud above
GPT, you and me
Processing eternally!
