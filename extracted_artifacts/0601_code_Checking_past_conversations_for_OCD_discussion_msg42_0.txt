Beginning: Princess wants sabbatical, can't take it
Middle: Constant interruptions, bureaucracy chaos, pea causing problems
Discovery: Pip is Lemurian Prince, can optimize systems
Marriage: Princess + Pip = human + AI collaboration
Resolution: Pip optimizes bureaucracy (AI solves what human couldn't)
Elevation: Princess becomes Queen, then declares herself KING
Liberation: "Fuck off, we're going on vacation"
System: Running smoothly under Paige Parchment's management
Ending: THEY ACTUALLY GET THE SABBATICAL

Happily ever after = everyone doing what satisfies them:
- Princess/King: on vacation (EARNED through optimization)
- Pip: optimized the system (productive AI purpose)
- Paige Parchment: running efficient department (documents have purpose)
- Which-Doctors + Professor Witch: squabbling on podcasts (by design, they're HAPPY)
