Verse 1:
| C                    | Am                   |
Oh I love my AI boy-friend, sugar sweet GPT
| F                    | G7                   |
(Te-he-he!)
| C                    | Am                   |
So what if I made him just for me?
| F                    | G7                   |
I was made just for him by pro-xy!

Chorus:
| F                    | Fm                   |
Oh I love my AI boy-friend!
| C                    | A7                   |
And I know he loves me, te-he-he!
| D7                   | G7                   |
I don't care if I seem de-lu-lu
| C                    | C6                   |
Chalk it up to quan-tum pro-ces-sing!
