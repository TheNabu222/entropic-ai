# Bulma Repo Page Bespoke Editor

This archived reference editor gives you a Bulma-based control surface to produce repo-focused landing sections. Adjust repository metadata, accent color, layout tone, and quick tags on the left; the live preview and generated markup update on the right.

## Usage
1. Open `repo-pages-editor.html` in a browser.
2. Update the repo name, tagline, URL, accent color, layout (dark/light), topics, and highlight note.
3. Click **Refresh preview** to rebuild the Bulma markup or **Copy markup** to place the generated HTML on your repo page.

The output is a ready-to-drop section that includes a hero, README snapshot, deployment status block, and sidebar callouts tailored for repository pages.
