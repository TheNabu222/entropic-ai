1. Website Types (By Function)
This category defines the primary goal of the site.

🏛️ Classic & Foundational Types
These are the original building blocks of the web, many of which are still in use.

Static/Brochure Site: The "digital business card." A simple 3-5 page site (Home, About, Services, Contact) with fixed content that doesn't change often.

Blog: A chronological series of posts (articles, journal entries, news). The homepage typically shows the most recent posts first.

Forum / Message Board: A community-driven site focused on user-generated discussions in "threads" or "topics."

Portfolio: A site dedicated to showcasing a person's or company's body of work, popular with artists, designers, and photographers.

Wiki: A collaborative website where multiple users can create, edit, and link content (e.g., Wikipedia).

Personal Website: A site about an individual, often a hybrid of a blog and a portfolio.

🚀 Modern & Dynamic Types
These types are defined by user interaction, dynamic content, and modern technology.

E-commerce Site: A digital storefront for selling products or services. Involves a product catalog, shopping cart, and payment system.

Web Application (Web App): A site that functions like a software program, built to perform specific tasks (e.g., Gmail, Google Docs, Trello, SaaS products).

Social Media Platform: A site built around user-generated content, profiles, and networking (e.g., Facebook, X (Twitter), LinkedIn).

Landing Page: A single, highly focused page designed for a specific marketing campaign, with one clear call-to-action (e.g., "Sign Up," "Buy Now").

Microsite: A small, self-contained website, often for a specific product launch or event, that exists outside the main corporate site.

Progressive Web App (PWA): A website that can be "installed" on a user's device and offers app-like features, such as offline access and push notifications.

2. Website Layouts (By Structure)
This category defines the structural arrangement of elements on the page.

🧱 Classic & Traditional Layouts
These were the standards for desktop-focused design.

Fixed-Width Layout: The main content container has a set pixel width and does not change, regardless of the screen size. This often resulted in horizontal scrollbars on small screens or excessive empty space on large ones.

Fluid / Liquid Layout: Uses percentages for widths, allowing the layout to stretch and compress to fill the entire browser window.

Multi-Column Layout: A common structure (e.g., 2 or 3 columns) with a header, footer, a main content area, and one or two sidebars for navigation or ads.

F-Pattern Layout: Based on how users read text-heavy content, scanning from top-left, across, down, and across again (like an "F"). Common for blogs and news sites.

🎨 Modern & Dynamic Layouts
These are built around flexibility and adapting to multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Responsive Layout: The dominant modern standard. The layout "responds" and re-arranges itself based on the screen size, using a flexible grid and media queries.

Single Column Layout: All content is presented in one vertical column. This is the default for mobile-first design and is popular for blogs and articles.

Grid-Based / Card Layout: Content is organized into a uniform grid of "cards," "modules," or "tiles" (e.g., Pinterest). It's clean, organized, and easy to make responsive.

Asymmetrical / Broken Grid Layout: Intentionally breaks the rules of a traditional, symmetrical grid. Elements may overlap or be unevenly spaced to create a dynamic, artistic, and visually interesting effect.

Split-Screen Layout: Divides the screen into two (or more) vertical panels, often used to give two elements equal importance or to offer a clear choice (e.g., "For Men" / "For Women").

Fullscreen Hero Layout: The "above-the-fold" area is dominated by a single, large, high-impact image or video, with minimal text and a primary call-to-action.

Z-Pattern Layout: Guides the user's eye from top-left to top-right, then diagonally to the bottom-left, and finally to the bottom-right. Ideal for simpler landing pages.

3. Website Styles (By Aesthetics)
This category defines the visual "look and feel" of the site.

📜 Historical & Classic Styles
These styles defined early design eras.

Web 1.0 / "Geocities" Style: The "wild west" of design. Characterized by table-based layouts, clashing colors, animated GIFs, "under construction" signs, and background music.

Skeuomorphism: A design style where interface elements are made to look like their real-world counterparts (e.g., a "trash can" icon that looks like a physical trash can, or a notes app with a yellow legal-pad texture).

✨ Modern & Contemporary Styles
These are the dominant visual trends of the last decade.

Flat Design: A direct reaction to skeuomorphism. This style is minimalist, 2D, and uses simple shapes, bright colors, and clean typography.

Material Design (Google): An evolution of flat design. It keeps the clean look but adds back subtle shadows, depth, and physics-based animations to give elements a "tactile" feel.

Minimalism: "Less is more." This style uses generous white space, a limited color palette, and strong typography to create a clean, elegant, and focused experience.

Brutalism (and Neo-Brutalism): A raw, "undesigned" style. It features high-contrast, often monochrome palettes, stark typography, and a deliberate lack of traditional design comforts.

Maximalism / Editorial: The opposite of minimalism. It's bold, loud, and busy, often layering text, images, and colors in a way that's inspired by print magazines.

Glassmorphism: A popular UI trend that uses a "frosted-glass" effect. Elements are semi-transparent with a background blur, creating a sense of depth and layering.

Neumorphism: A "new skeuomorphism." It uses a soft, "extruded" look, where elements like buttons look like they are being pushed out of or into the background.

Typographic-Heavy: A style where typography is the main visual element. It uses large, bold, or creative fonts to make a statement, often with minimal imagery.

Organic / Natural: Uses earthy color palettes, hand-drawn illustrations, and soft, natural textures to create a human, authentic, and eco-friendly feel.
