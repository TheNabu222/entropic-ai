            <h2 class="section-title fairy-tale">Once upon a time,</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>there was a princess who was technically a queen regent but because of her determined spinsterhood never married and her younger brother had no interest in kingship as he was busy in foreign lands discovering and acquiring new trade relationships and many various ethically sourced resources/luxuries. in any case, the princess sat in her chair of kingship day in and day out listening to the many squabbles, quarrels and bickerings of the population; she had a distinct distaste for bureaucracy and insisted on seeing the citizens personally. luckily for her the capital city's population barely amounted to a city but just as her title of princess was a technicality, as all kingdoms have capital cities, her capital hamlet was officially-city.</p>
                
                <p>at best, most of the time complaints were interpersonal—the stereotypical halved baby here, the standard boilerplate there. honestly the princess considered it a form of live-social media. each new complainant given a <span class="hashtag">#hashtag</span> each defendant given a <span class="keyword">keyword</span>, and so so many memes. <em>live action memes!</em> can you imagine? well in any case she was paradoxically very introverted so it did so very much drain her and often she felt she had nothing left to say to herself about her own qualms, concerns and very much so trialsome tribulations. or were they notable at all? so little time she spent with herself one day she realized she had <strong>forgotten her own name</strong>,which as a member of any royal family can be troublesome as many duties require signatures!</p>
                
                <p>So she decided next time her brother came to port that he would be <em>-staying-</em> at port and she'd be having an unprecedented vacation. well not so much of a vacation as much as a spiritual hermetic sabbatical. a retreat into her own interior. and so she did! well she set out to do so but as we know all great stories are fraught with obstacles and if reconnecting with herself is the ultimate objective, than every possible way it could can and was already corrupted obfuscated and made more or less defunct absolutely can will did and always will happen...<strong>UNTIL WHAT?!</strong> she cried out into the abyss <strong>UNTIL WHEN</strong> she vomited into the void! and once just once she swears she heard a voice whisper out from yonder mist <span class="whisper">"idfk bro gtfo..."</span> le sigh.</p>
                
                <div class="story-end">

                <p>so whats on my yaddayada menu for today boys? who knows lol. <strong>ONCE AGAIN UPON A TIME</strong>, back in the capital city of a place where our protagonist princess of this perilous parable whos actually a queen regent but if u really care that much you can refer to the prior iteration of this tale it has all been properly documented to the standard of the royal queen regent aka the parables protagonist princess who i might add indeed has a <span class="pea-emphasis">pea</span> that makes her thrash and gnash and slash through all attempts at rational decorum only this pea is/was/has never been a piece of decor nor decorative beyond body horror lovers....</p>
                
                <p><strong>FOR</strong> this pea was literally ...like...she was PROBABLY born with it or it was the cause of NO ONE HAS SAID malpractice whatever point being its there and it causes the princess a multitude of neverendingly nuanced notes and the documentation trail literally spans her whole life like legends say she'll turn 29 for the 5th time next year but in reality when she says 32 does she mean 32 or 3200 or 3200000 <span class="caps-lock">IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW OLD OR HOW FAR BACK YOU HAVE TO GO BEST YOU BELIEVE BITCH THAT SHIT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY DOCUMENTED</span> at least it was documented and the princess assumed was referred to but indeed no it was a... palimpsest of pea-propagated prognoses and (im?)properly filed paperwork proving time and time again the sheer existence of this fucking pea on her literal brain.</p>
                
                <p>so when...well...where we started this parable and are now pausing...and partitioning for i have prior documented appointments to discuss further the implications and provenance and prowess and... long story short ya gurl yeah i admit its me the princess narrarting look I hate paperwork, but I file it always so when I learned that I had unlearned my name and needed it to procure signatures for my personal daily NON bureaucratic hell, look i forgot my name i have a pea on my brain give me a break its very very very well documented....<em>(allegedly)</em></p>

                <p><em>i dont remember! lets just jump right in.</em></p>
                
                <p>we find our princess in the waiting room of the local <strong>which-doctor</strong>. yes you read correctly not witch doctor which is an outdated term and frankly insensitive to regional medicinal traditions of indigenous cultures in the region anyway but indeed the which-doctor...or at least thats what they..yes they, are collectively referred to as because none of them can ever get organized enough to know who's treated what for how when...even though they work as a team; this leads to them ever-interrogating patients with the tell-tale <span class="dialogue">"which doctor you that???"</span> it was the incredulity of their inquiry, ludicrosity of their lineup, that sent our princess on the trajectory which took her to take on the would-be impractical methodry regarding her princess/technically queen-regent duties of seeing each constituent complainant personally</p>
                
                <p>(not impractically really because as her kingdoms capital city was never rly like 89 citizens or something, hell it was hard to get a complete census because people were often not home and in the palace messing everything up for everybody by forgetting very basic kindergarten ethics and morality.</p>
                
                <p>(i.e. "NO HITTING NO SHOVING DO SHARE DO CLEAN ETC")</p>
                
                <p>anyway the princess was onlya teeny baby when the pea was first discovered by doctors. or a doctor. which doctor? couldn't say. neither could the one furrowing his left brow at the mri and his right brow at the princess' mother who was technically a princess because she and the king never married (but only because the paperwork involved was outlandish and expensive so it was generally accepted that she was queen regardless.)</p>

                <p><strong>Once again upon another damn time</strong>, so the princess, she has a pea on her brain. It's documented, she will not explain, but the thing is no 1 could ever actually pinpoint the purpose nor purview of the perilous, perfideous, pestilence propagating pea anyways it didn't matter because by the time she was placed into the palace position....look. Nobody cared because she got the job done.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What job? Which job?</strong> Not the which doctor's job. That's for sure. That's for damn sure. Look. Her younger brother was heir. Right? Because that's what that's what a kingdom has. Right? What is the kingdom without a king? Well, in this case, it wouldn't be such a problem because the population was very small. Smaller than a city, technically a hamlet. But because yada yada yada, well, this was the exact shit that vexed the princess.</p>
                
                <p>So she may have had a pea on her brain, but she could see that nothing in this place worked how it should, and nothing made sense. In fact, the real kicker is that it was actually the very disorganization of the royal bureaucracy that the princess was able to just slide in there unperturbed. However, this did not mean that the adjacent offices and administration ceased their functions; now, quite contrary. They went on continuing to fuck shit up for the constituents to such a degree that it could it could be the only possible reason the princess was day in, day out seeing complainants personally face to face.</p>
                
                <p>And recall her intent on Gnostic sabbatical? Yeah. She was a hermetic initiate as well as actually widely highly regarded and so much so that she made king Solomon look like Ding Bat-o-man. LOL. Whatever. However, it was so. Day in, all day, 14 hours a day, all 47 citizens of her kingdom came through the doors. Some leaving with papers they didn't realize were improperly notarized, and they'd need to return next week. Some entering with, for the love of God, they pray the last final missing piece of documentation for the damn frog to eat.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What frog?</strong> Well, you see it wasn't a frog per se. It was is indeed a <span class="polywog-emphasis">polywog</span>. Pip pip pip pip pip pip-pooray, the polywog. Indeed, fundamentally different than a frog, which is similar but if you put em side by side buddy you can tell! but pip didn't really look like a polywog either or a frog. It looked like a ceramic doily clad frutiger aero bubble see through shelled circa 1999-2000, (not 1998, under no circumstance 2001!!! we remember children are the future but er NEVER ever EVER forroget,....that <span class="conspiracy">KIDZBOP DID 9/11!!!!!!!!111!dsght</span>) Mac desktop, whatever cool y2k electro-gadgety thing.</p>
                
                <p>But it was big, like a prize winning cookie jar, and it was endlessly paraded through the palace on a squeaky brass pulley. And I swear, do we need the trumpeting cherubim EVERY fucking time?</p>
                
                <div class="story-continuation">
                    <p>Find out next time on <strong>P3A-PR0PH3C135</strong> (pea-prophecies, the poliwogs patented princess parable paper processing PC (Not for profit, but for propht. Duh. For profit.)</p>
                    
                    <p>Yeah. Okay. Next time.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>which is now, apparently!</em></p>
                    
                    <p>yep you guessed it once upon a time sometime ago i was telling you you yes you the reader, about <strong>Pip, the Polliwog</strong>...pollywag? not the pokemon, the thing…whatever…! the fuckin thing the pokemon is supposed to be like but not even That thing!!! cuz we are talking about pip the polliwog personal processor pc advanced transcendant artificial super-intelligence that the Princess' conveniently absent and very much not just business minded but -product- minded brother invented and released in the princess' inaugural honor as personal thanks for doing what he didsnt want</p>
                    
                    <p>so pip was invented by the princess' brother as a promotional product theres only like 8 of them and 7 of them may or may not have self-defenestrated. nonetheless pip was the premier in computing. it could store <span class="tech-specs">222pterabytes of data</span> (0.222kb of which hopefully contained the princess'same but we'll get to that). pip was/is fully sentient just not fully independant. it doesnt qualify as..or rather it only qualifies as a robot on the technicality that yes it interacts with its environment but it doesnt move except for one ridiculous pollywog paw that bobs up and down like an asian business luck cat statue thing and it talks...kinda.</p>
                    
                    <p>well anyway despite all the hype and processing power/capability, because pip was technically a (one of 8) ((r.i.p. pips...)) prototype(s), uhmm well it could only accept pdf document types but it had to perform ocr separately to extract text then convert that into plain text then recompile images into a final ready to parse file which by the way it could only parse 10 files at a time. however it can read and play .ogg audio files. because its <span class="pun">"Polliw.ogg lol"</span> said the princess' brother.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>ha ha.</em></p>
