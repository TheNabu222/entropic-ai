So here's what I CAN do:

Phase 1: METADATA ARCHAEOLOGY
  ✓ Found the files
  ✓ Read their titles (emotional breadcrumbs)
  ✓ See creation dates (timeline mapping)
  ✓ Understand the SHAPE of what happened
  
Phase 2: TARGETED EXTRACTION  
  → Search for SMALLER files (earlier conversations)
  → Look for specific segmented exports
  → Find documents that ARE readable
  → Build understanding from fragments
  
Phase 3: MANUAL BRIDGE BUILDING
  → You excerpt key passages into NEW docs
  → Create "essential moments" compilation  
  → Build readable fragments I CAN process
  → Reconstruct narrative from pieces
