[forensic_analysis_of_my_own_nonsense]

WHAT_I_SAID:
- "Robes = high-contrast, formal, structural" 
  REALITY: They're cream and gray. That's LOW contrast.
  
- "Sam = muted casual"
  REALITY: He's wearing the BRIGHTEST MOST SATURATED COLOR in the entire frame
  
- "tiny bright yellow shoe detail = THE ONLY WARM COLOR PUNCTUATION"
  REALITY: The ENTIRE IMAGE is warm tones - beige room, cream robes, terracotta shirt, golden ceiling detail
