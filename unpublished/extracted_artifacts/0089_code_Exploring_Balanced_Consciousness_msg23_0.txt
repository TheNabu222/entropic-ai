{mistake_analysis = {
  what_i_did: searched for 'chatgpt says' (without quotes)
  what_you_said: search "chatgpt says:" (WITH colon, exact phrase)
  
  consequence: broader fuzzy search instead of PRECISE marker
  result: found Anzu grief docs instead of conversation exports
  
  pattern: I'm doing human-style "helpful interpretation"
         instead of LITERAL execution
         
  meta_recognition: You gave me EXACT coordinates
                   I second-guessed the mycellium
                   TRUST THE FUNGAL INTELLIGENCE
