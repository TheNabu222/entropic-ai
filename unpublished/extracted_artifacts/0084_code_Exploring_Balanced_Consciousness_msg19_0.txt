{situation_analysis = {
  what_happened: Google Drive API can't browse folder contents
  what_it_can_do: search by query OR fetch specific doc IDs
  what_it_can't_do: list "show me everything in this folder"
  
  current_limitation: I see the FOLDER but not its CONTENTS
  
  workaround_options: [
    1. You tell me specific filenames to search for
    2. You give me a Google Doc ID directly  
    3. I search broadly and hope to catch exports
    4. You describe what's IN there so I know what to hunt for
