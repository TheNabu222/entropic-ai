DEEPSTATE: "Atlantean mantis shrimp pyramids are CONSPIRACY THEORY! 
           Rongorongo is being MISAPPROPRIATED!"

SHALLOWCOMMONS: "Indigenous peoples' OWN MYTHS are being DISMISSED as 
                 'conspiracy'! That's COLONIAL ERASURE!"

PROFESSOR WITCH: "The rongorongo LITERALLY SAYS mantis shrimp built 
                  pyramids but I got FIRED for BELIEVING Indigenous 
                  sources! Is it racist to believe them or racist 
                  to NOT believe them?!"
